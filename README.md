# LoRa Communication with NodeMCU and SX1278

This repository contains the schematic diagrams and brief instructions for setting up a communication system between two NodeMCUs using LoRa RA-02 SX1278 DIP modules.

## Components Used
- **NodeMCU** (ESP8266)
- **LoRa RA-02 SX1278 DIP** module
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard** (optional)
- **Power Supply**

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple communication system where one NodeMCU acts as a sender and the other as a receiver. The sender transmits data wirelessly using the LoRa SX1278 module, and the receiver picks up this data.

## How to Use
1. **Connect the hardware** according to the provided schematic diagrams.
2. **Upload the respective code** to the NodeMCUs (Sender and Receiver).
3. Use the **Serial Monitor** on both devices to observe the communication.
